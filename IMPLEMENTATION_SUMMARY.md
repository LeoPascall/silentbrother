## 🎓 Learning Resources

### How Animations Work
Your website uses the Intersection Observer API to detect when elements are visible, then triggers animations. Cards fade in with a scale effect as you scroll down. This is efficient and performant.

### Video Embeds
YouTube iframes are used for responsive video embedding. They automatically adapt to screen size while maintaining 16:9 aspect ratio. The `aspect-ratio: 16/9` CSS property ensures consistency.

### Responsive Grid
CSS Grid automatically adjusts columns based on screen size:
- Desktop: 4 columns (approach) / 5 columns (gaming)
- Tablet: 2 columns
- Mobile: 1 column
