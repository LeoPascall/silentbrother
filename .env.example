# Silent Brother - Email Credentials

## Gmail Configuration for Nodemailer

To use Gmail for email delivery, you need to create a `.env` file with an app password.

### Steps to Get Gmail App Password:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication:**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Click "2-Step Verification"
   - Follow the steps to enable 2FA

2. **Generate App Password:**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" and "Windows Computer" (or your device)
   - Click "Generate"
   - Copy the 16-character password

3. **Create `.env` file:**
   ```env
   EMAIL_USER=dualoznebusiness@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_16_character_password_here
   ADMIN_EMAIL=dualoznebusiness@gmail.com
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

4. **Save and start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` file to version control
- Use app passwords, not your actual Gmail password
- Rotate passwords periodically
- Keep email credentials secure

## Troubleshooting

**"Invalid login" error:**
- Ensure 2FA is enabled
- Use app password, not Gmail password
- Check EMAIL_USER format (should be full Gmail address)

**"Attachments not sending":**
- Check file size (max 50MB)
- Ensure files are being properly uploaded

**"No confirmation email":**
- Check SMTP settings
- Verify EMAIL_USER has correct permissions
- Check spam folder
